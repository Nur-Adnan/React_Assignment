    "review_text": "My process for studying this text is to read a section at a time and walk through the examples illustrated. I often struggle with the math that is being demonstrated as a proof for the algorithm. I then research an actual example of the topic discussed and watch a youtube video that demonstrates it in application.",

    "review_text": "This book is impressive! It covers a lot of subject matter and is clearly worded. However, you're going to get lost because this often reads more like a reference manual than a conversation that appeals to intuition. You'll be pushed into analyzing algorithms for theoretical data structures that you fuzzily remember (if at all).",

    "review_text": "yes, yes, it's an algorithm book but it looks like they expect you to be fluent in math so don't expect a primer here. great at making me looks smart to people who look at my bookshelf. I found 'easier' descriptions of common algorithms online but If you already know math like a boss, this would be pretty helpful. Better bring some water because its also pretty dry reading.",

    "review_text": "I, like many others, was sold a counterfeit version of this book (confirmed by the publisher) where the pages were of poor quality and fell out very easily. Even so, despite the seller not responding to multiple messages, Amazon REFUSED to follow through on their A to Z guarentee. I recommend NOT buying (anything) from Amazon for this reason. I ended up purchasing a new copy from a legitimate seller (Barnes and Noble) as shown in the photo at the top, and you can really tell the difference! Lessons learned; will NEVER buy from Amazon again.",

You clearly can see from the images that it is not possible seeing the missing pages from the side of the tome that means the book is was originally faulty. Over Â£32!
